<h3>How It is Made:</h3>
---
<h5>Tech Stack Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h5>
<br>
---
<h6>Using the dog ceo api, a collection of breed with assigned images are called on selection. The names, likes, dislikes and funfact of the breeds are shuffled using a for loop. The yates shuffle was also used to providea more even shuffle occurrence. The light blue tone for the background was selected as this dog shelter site is meant to be friendly and welcoming to users.</h6>

<h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
